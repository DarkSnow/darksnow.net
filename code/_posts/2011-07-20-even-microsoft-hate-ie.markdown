While wandering the web looking for a work around to a bug in IE (versions 7 upwards) I came across a very interesting little website run by Microsoft.

[The IE6 Countdown](http://www.ie6countdown.com/).

From this very website:

> 10 years ago a browser was born.
> Its name was Internet Explorer 6. Now that we're in 2011, in an era of modern web standards, it's time to say goodbye.
> This website is dedicated to watching Internet Explorer 6 usage drop to less than 1% worldwide, so more websites can choose to drop support for Internet Explorer 6, saving hours of work for web developers.

I have to, perhaps for the first time, whole heartedly agree with Microsoft on this, IE6 should die. It should have died a long time ago, and nobody, not even MS, are supporting it any more.

Some of the stats from that page are interesting though. IE6, not the rest of them, but the decade old IE6, it still at over ten percent world wide usage at the time of writing. Look at the hot spots on the map and you'll see that in China more than a third of internet users use IE6. Perhaps not a problem there given the amount of &ldquo;web&rdquo; they get to use. But Korea and India are still pretty high too.

One thing I'd like to point out though. In the quote above, from that very web page that Microsoft have crafted, it says that in an era of modern web standards, it's time to say goodbye.

They are obviously talking about the aged IE6 but I think anyone who looks at those standards and sees how they are implemented across all browser, anyone who has spent hours changing code that works perfectly in all other browsers, will know that it's not just version 6, but all versions of IE that we need to bid a fond farewell too.

Good luck in spreading the word MS, I hope people get the message.
