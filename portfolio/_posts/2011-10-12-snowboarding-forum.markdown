Due to my keen interest in snowboarding and, at the time, a lack of people to go with, I joined a snowboarding forum. That forum was a big success and was eventually sold off to a company that wanted to use the success of that site to make money, the result was a site riddled with intrusive advertising.

One day somebody asked if anyone could create a new forum. I said I could and in reply I got a link to phpbb. Almost as a joke, in about an hour, I created a new forum, just to show the new owners how easy it would be, and in just a few days around two hundred people joined.

Now on it's own domain and with a properly installed and customised installation of phpbb, DarkSnow is known to a good few people in the UK snowboarding community and has been, much to my surprise, quite successful.
